h1. In depth stuff. Sorry.
 
We're working with a GUI, and that means you've got a lot more things to think about. So before we get started on what additional syntax we have to deal with iOS dev, we're going to have to get some words right.

|_. name|_. meaning|
|Objective-C| Objective-C is a programming language, the ones you have heard  of around here would be Ruby, Javascript and Coffeescript. They all have their plusses and negatives.|
|Frameworks or Libraries| A framework or library is a collection of classes made for you to use, in C++ you probably use std as your library, and in Java, well, I guess you used Java's native classes.|
|UIKit| UIKit is the framework that gives us all the shiney touch controls, and provides access to everything from the accelerometer to the speakers.|
|#| This is a hash. This is a pound: Â£|

When writing applications for iOS, you say you're writing Objective-C with UIKit.
