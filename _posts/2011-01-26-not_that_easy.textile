h1. Alas, it's not that easy. 
 
We're working with a GUI, and that means you've got a lot more things to think about. So before we get started on what additional syntax we have to deal with iOS dev, we're going to have to get some words right.

|_. name|_. meaning|
|Objective-C| Objective-C is a programming language, a lot like C++. It's got a few tricks up its sleeve that gives it some advantages over C++ at the expense of some speed. It's really only used on Mac OS X and iOS.|
|Frameworks or Libraries| A framework or library is a collection of classes made for you to use, in C++ you probably use std as your library, and in Java, well, I guess you used Java's native classes.|
|UIKit| UIKit is the framework that gives us all the shiney touch controls, and provides access to everything from the accelerometer to the speakers.|
|Cocoa| Cocoa is the framework that UIKit is built off, when you see classes beginning with NS they come from Cocoa. Like NSString. Cocoa's been around since the NextStep days in the 80s.|
|#| This is a hash. This is a pound: Â£|

When writing applications for iOS, you say you're writing Objective-C with UIKit.
