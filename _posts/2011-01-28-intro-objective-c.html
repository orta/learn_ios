    <h2>iOS / Mac OS X we use objective-c. It's pretty crazy.</h2>
    <p>Like C++ objects we use Header files. These files are a way of showing what the object will do, so you can quickly get an overview of responsibilities.</p>

    <div>
        <h4 class="code_heading ">Car.h ( Obj-C Header )</h4>
        {% highlight objc %}
#import < Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Car : NSObject(
  // object variables go here
  int speed;
  int wheels;

)

// object functions ( or methods ) go outside
-(void)drive;
-(void)honk;

@end
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>After looking at this we can tell that a car has a speed variable, and a wheels variable, though we don't know what they are. Because we cannot set their values in the header.</p>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Its complement is the implementation file.</h2>
    
    <h4 class="code_heading ">Car.m ( Obj-C Implementation )</h4>
    {% highlight objc %}
    #import "Car.h"

    @implementation Car

    -(id)init {
        self = [super init];
        speed = 10;
        wheels = 4;
        return self;
    }

    -(void) honk {
        NSLog(@"Beep");
    }

    @end
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p> NSLog() is like cout, or like println() it lets us write things out to the debug log.</p>
