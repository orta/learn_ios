h1. XCode 3
 
XCode holds all your project files, you can see in there a few m files, a few h files a xib file and some other supporting files. I wouldnt worry about those. 

The xib file is an InterfaceBuilder file, and it is what you use to connect objects together and to make your shiney interfaces. You can also spot a few frameworks included at the bottom.
