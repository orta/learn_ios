            <h1>Object Oriented Programming 101</h1>
            <h2>Classes are great. We use them to model things.</h2>            <p>Wanna make a chess game? Then you'll probably want to create a class for each of the types of pieces on the board, and a class for the board itself.</p>
            <p>In our last examples: String is a class.</p>

            <p>Objects are great because we can have lots of similar objects either inherit a lot of behavior from each other, for example. You may want to make a driving game. You can make a car object, then have other cars inherit from it and do more with the object.</p>

            <h4 class="code_heading">Car object (psudo code)</h4>
            {% highlight cpp %}
class Car {
    wheels = 4
    speed = 10

    drive(){
        go_forwards( speed )
    }

    honk(){
        say "beeep"
    }
}
            {% endhighlight %}

        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p>We can take the car object and extend it to make different types of cars without having to re-write large chunks of code.</p>
